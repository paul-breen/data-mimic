## Data Mimic

This project enables dynamic visualisations of overlaid schematics.  In particular, it can use a PLC Data Server (PDS) as its data source, thereby providing SCADA-like mimics.

This project consists of the datamimic modules, and a simple Flask web application, to provide a web API to access the mimics.
